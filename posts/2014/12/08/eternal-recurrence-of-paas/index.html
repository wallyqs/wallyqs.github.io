<p>Distributed Systems are hard.</p>
<p>As a service grows popular, there inevitably comes the time that capability to <b>scale</b> is demanded from
  a system, and while doing so it is required that the system has <b>uptime</b>.
  As we go on tackling such issues, it results that we end up with a
  distributed system that becomes increasingly complex and its
  understanding requires an ongoing online computation of its state.</p>
<p>Under such a system, failures are a constant, and whether this failure
  ends up in tragedy or not, depends on how well the platform developer
  was prepared for such events.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
  <p><img src="/public/cat-theorem.png" alt="/public/cat-theorem.png" /></p>
  <p><b>Fig. 1.</b> <i>The CAT theorem</i> (coined by <a href="http://www.schwertly.com/">Stan</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Then, what if while at handling this complexity, or a tragic event that ends up in firefighting,
  (<i>in your loneliest loneliness</i> as Nietzche puts it),
  a demon came up to you and reveal that it doesn&#8217;t
  get any better? That <a href="http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2482856">there is no way around it</a>,
  and &#8221;<i>this life which you live must be lived by you once again and innumerable times more; and every pain and joy and thought and sigh must come again to you, all in the same sequence</i>&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nietzche poses as the outcome of this thought experiment
  one out of two possible choices: the individual either accepts it and becomes stronger
  from the cognitive process triggered as a result of the tragedy (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati">amor fati</a></i>),
  or the individual succumbs to what he calls <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ressentiment">Ressentiment</a></i>.</p>
<p>The platform developer, by attempting to build and operate a
  distributed system, will continuously be exposed to a set of challenges
  that will end up with having to face this test of character.</p>
<p>Such as in life (which is itself some sort of distributed system too),
  in a distributed system, tragedy is a constant.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem">CAP theorem</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_%28computer_science%29#Solvability_results_for_some_agreement_problems">FPL result</a>,
  are just a couple of examples which show the constant tragedy that comes
  along with operating distributed systems.</p>
<p>For the platform developer that does not succumb to ressentiment, what
  lies ahead is easy to predict: it will reflect on the tragedy and use
  the literature to improve the situation and in the end, succeed like
  others have before in taming a system with many moving parts without
  shying away from the difficult problems.  Tackling and understanding the
  tradeoffs around fault tolerance, high availability, distributed
  agreement, etc&#8230; all lead to a living a good life for the platform
  developer.</p>
<p>But what about the platform developer that succumbs to <i>ressentiment</i>?</p>
<p>Like the quote from Tolstoy goes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my experience (and under my line of reasoning stated in the previous
  paragraphs), when such thing happens it could be possible to see some
  of the following behaviors below for example:</p>
<h6>Cynism, Skepticism</h6>
<p>We can avoid having to scale by keeping services small.
  Instead of having shared infrastructure we could make everyone in the company run
  a similar version of the same, then <i>they</i> have to take care of
  running it.  There is no need to have a platform even if we have
  hundreds of nodes.</p>
<p>This platform developer has experienced the pains of having to operate
  a distributed system.  Microservices <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html">are</a> <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/4/8/microservices-not-a-free-lunch.html">hard</a>, and maybe unnecessary if
  complying to enough trade offs. It is ok to be uncompetitive in
  terms of platform related efforts and just keeping it simple.</p>
<p>The platform developer keeps the level of automation such that there
  is heavy partitioning and waste in the data center and tries to delegate
  difficult issues to avoid tragedies around operating a complex system.</p>
<h6>The sysadmin as practitioner of a slave morality</h6>
<p>A developer either aware or unaware of the challenges of having to run
  a distributed system may try to shield himself/herself of the issue.</p>
<p>As a result of the lack of empathy by the developer,
  a platform developer may develop <i>ressentiment</i> towards the opressors,
  that is the developers who lack empathy to the problem of tackling
  scalability issues.</p>
<h6>&#8220;Hell is other developers&#8221;</h6>
<p><i>Ressentiment</i> is to those that do not understand the situation in the
  the data center, and to those heavy users who are causing the architecture
  continue to grow.</p>
<p>The problem is not the platform, but the architecture of the application.
  Had the application architechture been designed properly there wouldn&#8217;t be a need to have as many servers.</p>
<p>Or there could be <i>ressentiment</i> as well to those users who for analytics purposes capture everything and produce lots of data.
  In case it is for auditing purposes, <i>ressentiment</i> then is towards those who audit.</p>
<p>The platform developer becomes more used to externalize issues that
  could be fixed in the platform on the users rather than fixing them.</p>
<h5>Conclusion</h5>
<p>It is my believe then that, compared to other areas of software
  development, there is a <i>Tragic Sense of Life</i> which
  has to be acknowledged earlier on when faced with operating
  a distributed system running in production, that is if one is set to the task of doing it correctly.</p>
<p>It is also my believe that even after much tragedy, a platform developer
  with ressentiment still has chance to overcome it and attempt to
  tackle the core issues of building a distributed system.
  It takes start asking &#8220;Why?&#8221; and then proceed to start reading papers,
  looking for someone else that has posed the same question
  (many times these fundamental questions already have been answered <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs240/readings/lamport.pdf">decades ago</a>&#8230;)</p>

<p>Some links that have helped me out learning about distributed systems:</p>

  <dt>Distributed Systems for fun and profit</dt><dd>
    I have found this book very useful to immerse in the basics of
    working with distributed systems.
    <a href="http://book.mixu.net/distsys/">http://book.mixu.net/distsys/</a></dd>
  <dt><i>Distributed Systems Archaeology</i> talk by Michael Bernstein</dt><dd>
    Another great talk by a man with an obsession which I can&#8217;t
    recommend enough.

  <dt>Papers we love</dt><dd>
    There are many great distributed systems related videos of the meetups available
    <a href="http://paperswelove.org/">http://paperswelove.org/</a></dd>
  <dt>A Brief Tour of FLP Impossibility</dt><dd>
    TL;DR;
    &#8220;it’s not possible to say whether a processor has crashed or is simply taking a long time to respond.&#8221;
    <a href="http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/">http://the-paper-trail.org/blog/a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility/</a></dd>
  <dt>The CAP Theorem</dt><dd>
    Paper itself can be found at Papers we love <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/distributed_systems/brewers-conjecture.pdf">repo</a>. But
    the Distributed Systems for fun and profit book covers it in the
    <a href="http://book.mixu.net/distsys/abstractions.html">chapter 2</a> as well.</dd>
