  <p>

  I'm a Tokyo based full stack developer specializing in PaaS & logging technologies,
  as well as declarative approaches around the deployment of workloads.

  In the past, I have participated in communities such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a> (formerly HackerSchool).

  Originally from Guadalajara, Mexico (also known as the 
  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/beyond-the-maquiladora-a-look-at-mexicos-startup-scene/">Engineering Hub from Mexico</a>)

  In October 2010, I moved to Tokyo to join Rakuten during its initial
  stages of globalization as part of the Rakuten Research team,
  where I had my first experience working in a completely Japanese environment. 

  Then in 2012, I moved on as one of the first members of Rakuten PaaS team
  to help in its launch.  It was a Cloudfoundry based solution, and we needed
  persistent logs so I implemented its logging infrastructure
  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rakutentech/fluentd-meetup-logging-infrastructure-in-paa-s"> using Fluentd.</a>  

  I am proficient in Japanese (JLPT 2 - Business level), English & Spanish.
  
  My editor is Emacs and its always full of Org mode buffers
  (if Org mode support in Github is broken <a href="https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby/issues">please ping me</a>)
