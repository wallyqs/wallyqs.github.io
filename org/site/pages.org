      I'm available for new opportunities! :)    
    </a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'm a Tokyo based full stack developer specializing in PaaS & logging technologies,
    as well as declarative approaches around the deployment of workloads.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the past, I have participated in communities such as <a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a> and <a href="http://recurse.com">the Recurse Center</a> (formerly HackerSchool).
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally from Guadalajara, Mexico (also known as the
    <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2015/03/26/beyond-the-maquiladora-a-look-at-mexicos-startup-scene/">Engineering Hub from Mexico</a>)
  </p>

  <p>
    In October 2010, I moved to Tokyo to join Rakuten during its initial
    stages of globalization as part of the Rakuten Research team,
    where I had my first experience working in a completely Japanese environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then in 2012, I moved on as one of the first members of Rakuten PaaS team
    to help in its launch.  It was a Cloudfoundry based solution, and we needed
    persistent logs so I implemented its logging infrastructure
    <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/rakutentech/fluentd-meetup-logging-infrastructure-in-paa-s"> using Fluentd.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    I am proficient in Japanese (JLPT 2 - Business level), English & Spanish.
  </p>

  <p>  My editor is Emacs. Also, I really, really like Org mode, so if support in Github is broken <a href="https://github.com/wallyqs/org-ruby/issues">please ping me</a>.
  </p>
