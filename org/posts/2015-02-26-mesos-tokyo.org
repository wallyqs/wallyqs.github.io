#+TITLE:	Talked at the Tokyo Mesos Meetup #1
#+CATEGORY:	posts
#+LAYOUT:	post

Yesterday it was held the first Mesos related even here in Tokyo.
It seems that interest Mesos had accumulated for some time now around here,
so the place quickly filled up even though it was the first event.

I gave a quick talk on some of the basics around writing schedulers for Mesos,
(it has been a while since I presented in Japanese!). Slides below:
